Technologies used:

2. CSS: Styles the visual layout and appearance. Implemented our blue gradient background and responsive layout and controlling spacing, hover effects, and media queries.
3. JavaScript: Added dynamic behavior and client-side logic. Handling our form validation, button interactions, and DOM manipulation.
4. jQuery: Simplified JavaScript syntax and DOM operations.
5. Firebase: Provided cloud-based backend services. Manages user authentication (login/logout) and hosted our web app as well as handling real-time data sync.
6. SQL Server; Relational database used in earlier versions of our project, we then migrated to firebase due to the challenges and to also improve scalability and real-time capabilities.
